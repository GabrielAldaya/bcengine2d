<h2>Known issues</h2>

<h3>Cropped characters</h3>

<p>With some fonts, some characters are cropped. An example is Bitstream's Cyberbit font, where the bottom of the 
square bracket characters are cropped off in some font sizes.</p>

<p>This is a compatibility problem between the font and GDI, not a problem in this application by itself. You get 
the same problem in WordPad for example. I will however try out other font rasterizers, to see if I can fix this 
problem in a future version.</p>

<h3>Rotated characters</h3>

<p>Some font files have some but not all subsets with characters rotated by 90 degrees. For example @Arial Unicode MS, 
with subset Enclosed Alphanumerics. This is not an error, but a feature of that font file. With the font rotated 
like this it permits writing texts in normal text editors as if they were in vertical lines.</p>

<h3>Large bitmap fonts switch to Arial</h3>

<p>Some bitmap fonts, e.g. FixedSys, may switch to Arial when generating very large fonts. This is a side effect of
BMFont using GDI for rasterizing the fonts. As GDI doesn't support rendering these bitmap fonts at very large sizes it 
automatically switches to the default TrueType font, Arial, instead.</p>

<h3>Texture file names with more than 2 digits for page number</h3>

<p>For fonts with a large number of characters, or few characters per page, the number of texture files can exceed 100,
in which case the file names begin to use more than 2 digits for the page number. Although this may cause 
inconvencience for applications that rely on the texture files following the same fixed pattern for all file names, I 
do not consider this a bug in BMFont. Instead the user should adjust the font size or texture size to lower the number 
of texture files generated per font. This will not only avoid the differently named files, but will also improve the 
performance of the application that uses the font as there will be less texture swaps while rendering the font.</p>

<h3>Sound is played when selecting items in the list views on Windows Vista</h3>

<p>On Windows Vista you might hear a sound anytime an item is selected in the list views, either the unicode charset 
list or the image manager list. It seems that this is actually 
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/larryosterman/archive/2008/09/25/why-specify-snd-nodefault-when-calling-playsound.aspx">a bug in Windows Vista</a>, 
and will likely be fixed by Microsoft in a future patch.</p>
